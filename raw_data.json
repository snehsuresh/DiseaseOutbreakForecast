            "description": "<p>A five-day mass polio vaccination campaign in the Gaza Strip concluded on Wednesday, reaching nearly 603 000 children under 10 years of age with novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) following comprehensive, simultaneous access to all five governorates during the ongoing ceasefire. The campaign was conducted as part of emergency efforts to end an ongoing poliovirus outbreak and prevent further spread in the Gaza Strip.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During this round, an additional 40 000 children were vaccinated as compared to the previous two rounds conducted in September and October 2024, after poliovirus was detected in the Gaza Strip. The ceasefire enabled health workers to reach more children who had missed vaccinations due to displacement during the phased approach, living in areas that previously required special coordination for access, or being unreachable during the October 2024 round due to insecurity in North Gaza, including Jabalia, Beit Lahiya, and Beit Hanoun.</p><p>Strong community engagement and awareness of vaccination benefits had maintained high immunization rates in the Gaza Strip, where 89% of children received the third dose of oral polio vaccine in 2023, before the conflict.&nbsp; This round drew upon 1660 vaccination teams, 1242 of which were mobile, and deployed 1242 social mobilizers. Despite bad weather conditions, families welcomed the initiative and brought their children to points where they could receive the polio vaccine.&nbsp; </p>\n<p>The campaign was conducted by the Palestinian Ministry of Health and implemented with support from the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), and other partners. </p>\n<p>As part of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative&rsquo;s commitment to mount a robust poliovirus outbreak response, surveillance for disease in children and for virus circulation in the environment has also been intensified since July 2024. It was this timely surveillance that detected ongoing environmental circulation of the virus, and the need to conduct additional vaccination to protect children.&nbsp; </p>\n<p>As the ceasefire provides an opportunity to resume critical public health functions, working to recover Gaza&rsquo;s previously strong disease surveillance and routine immunization are the best ways to protect children from polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases. Ending polio hinges on fully vaccinating every last child with polio vaccines.&nbsp; Ensuring uninterrupted access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene, and proper nutrition will protect children from many diseases including polio.</p>\n<p>WHO, UNICEF and partners continue to call for a lasting ceasefire that leads to long-term health and peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n",

Building on the success of the <a href=\"https://whofoundation.donorsupport.co/page/FUNEKRBXNHP\">1 Dollar 1 World campaign</a>, the World Health Organization (WHO) is now amplifying and evolving the initiative to encourage more people around the world to show their solidarity.</p><p>Inspired by an individual&rsquo;s initiative, WHO is now backing the 1 Dollar 1 World movement, encouraging regions, countries, champions, and its own workforce to unite behind the effort. Together with the WHO Foundation, WHO will strengthen its efforts to create awareness about its critical work and engage communities worldwide.<br /></p><p>With this initiative, WHO is embracing a new approach by leveraging crowdfunding to support its mission. For the first time, WHO is activating its existing infrastructure &ndash; spanning 150 country offices &ndash; alongside the WHO Foundation&rsquo;s reach, to amplify this grassroots movement. This strategic shift not only strengthens community engagement but also aligns with WHO&rsquo;s broader strategy to diversify funding sources and support its ongoing Investment Round.<br /></p><p>Since its launch in early 2025, almost 5000 people from over 140 countries have contributed to the campaign through the <a href=\"https://who.foundation/\">WHO Foundation</a>, created to bring together funders and high impact health initiatives to further the mission of WHO. The high level of success and engagement demonstrates that there is a broad sense of solidarity and shared commitment to global health. This campaign is not just about crowdfunding &ndash; it&rsquo;s about people standing together to remind us that health is a right, not a privilege.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The power of the 1 Dollar, 1 World movement comes from the people. In particular, I would like to thank my colleague Tania Cernuschi for her inspiration to launch this initiative,&rdquo; said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. &ldquo;It shows that in times of crisis, people everywhere can unite and commit to protecting and promoting the health of others. WHO is proud to stand behind this initiative, which embodies the values of solidarity, action, innovation and hope.&rdquo;</p><h2><strong>A moment for action</strong></h2><p>The challenges global health has faced in recent years &ndash; from pandemics to humanitarian crises &ndash; make it clearer than ever that no one is safe until everyone is safe. The 1 Dollar 1 World movement is a chance for people everywhere to turn concern into action and show that solidarity, just like health, knows no borders.</p><p>&ldquo;This campaign started with one person, but it belongs to all of us,&rdquo; said Tania Cernuschi, the WHO staff member who launched the original initiative. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s proof that individuals can make a difference, and that together, we are stronger.&rdquo;</p><h2><strong>Join the movement</strong></h2><p>Media and the public are invited to support and share this movement. Every action &ndash; whether a donation, a post, or a conversation &ndash; helps spread the message that health should be for all, not just for some. Every stakeholder &ndash; whether a person, an organization, a community or a government &ndash; has a role in building efficient and effective collaboration for health.</p><h2><strong>A grassroots campaign with global impact</strong></h2><p>The 1 Dollar 1 World movement invites everyone to take action for global health in three simple ways:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://whofoundation.donorsupport.co/page/FUNEKRBXNHP\">Donate</a> through the WHO Foundation &ndash; Every dollar counts. Contributions support WHO&rsquo;s lifesaving work worldwide.</li><li>Share &ndash; Post a photo holding up your index finger to symbolize unity. Use #1Dollar1World &amp; #HealthForAll, and link to the <a href=\"https://whofoundation.donorsupport.co/page/FUNEKRBXNHP\">donation page</a>.</li><li>Amplify &ndash; Encourage others to join the movement. More information is in the <a href=\"https://new.express.adobe.com/webpage/nJ80M156vrKON\">communications toolkit</a>.</li></ul><p>All donations, collected by the WHO Foundation, support lifesaving efforts around the world, with a strong focus on country-level initiatives. These resources are essential in driving impactful implementation where it matters most based on the decisions of WHO&rsquo;s 194 Member States. Together, we can drive real change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

            "description": "<p>The emergency polio outbreak response in the Gaza Strip is continuing, with a mass vaccination campaign scheduled from 22 to 26 February 2025. The novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) will be administered to over 591 000 children under 10 years of age to protect them from polio. This campaign follows the recent detection of poliovirus in wastewater samples in Gaza, signaling ongoing circulation in the environment, putting children at risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Pockets of individuals with low or no immunity provide the virus an opportunity to continue spreading and potentially cause disease. The current environment in Gaza, including overcrowding in shelters and severely damaged water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure, which facilitates fecal-oral transmission, create ideal conditions for further spread of poliovirus. Extensive population movement consequent to the current ceasefire is likely to exacerbate the spread of poliovirus infection.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Two previous vaccination rounds in the Gaza Strip were successfully conducted in September and October 2024, reaching over 95% of the target. As poliovirus is found to remain in the environment, additional vaccination efforts are needed to reach every child and strengthen population immunity. The presence of the virus still poses a risk to children with low or no immunity, in Gaza and throughout the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In 2024, health workers faced significant challenges accessing certain areas of central, north and south Gaza, which required special coordination to enter during the conflict. In inaccessible areas such as Jabalia, Beit Lahiya, and Beit Hanoun, where humanitarian pauses for the vaccination campaign were not assured, approximately 7 000 children missed vaccination during the second round. The recent ceasefire means health workers have considerably better access now.\u202f&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>No additional polio cases have been reported since a ten-month-old child was paralyzed in August 2024, but the new environmental samples from Deir al Balah and Khan Younis, collected in December 2024 and January 2025, confirm poliovirus transmission. The strain detected is genetically linked to the poliovirus detected in the Gaza Strip in July 2024.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>The upcoming vaccination campaign aims to reach all children under 10 years of age, including those previously missed, to close immunity gaps and end the outbreak. The use of the oral polio vaccine will help end this outbreak by preventing the spread of the virus. An additional polio vaccination round is planned to be implemented in April.</p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The campaign will be led by the Palestinian Ministry of Health and implemented with support from the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) and other partners.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Polio vaccines are safe and there is no maximum number of times a child should be vaccinated. Each dose gives additional protection which is needed during an active polio outbreak.&nbsp;\u202f&nbsp;</p><p>WHO, UNICEF, and partners welcome the recent ceasefire and urge for a lasting ceasefire that leads to long-term peace. &nbsp;<br /></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2>",

            "description": "<p>The recent surge in violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo has led to significant loss of life, trauma, displacement, and the destruction of critical health infrastructure, exacerbating an already dire situation for millions of people.</p><p>The situation remains tense and volatile, and the health needs are immense. WHO remains on the ground, and has continued to respond to the health needs by providing lifesaving medical supplies, supporting health workers, and coordinating the emergency response.</p><p>Hospitals and morgues are overwhelmed. Since 26&nbsp;January, 3082 injured and 843 dead have been reported from 31 health facilities in and around Goma, North Kivu.</p><p>With the alarming expansion of violence further south, 65 injuries were reported from 3 hospitals in South Kivu.</p><p>These numbers are expected to rise further as more injured people are able to reach health facilities and more dead bodies are gathered off the streets. Wound infections are a risk for those who have not been able to reach health care facilities quickly, and as health facilities are running out of supplies they need to clean and disinfect.</p><p>The sight of bodies lying uncared for is distressing. Though the bodies of people who have died from injury do not generally carry or spread disease, it is the right of the dead to be identified and receive proper burial, and important for the living to know their loved ones have received this care. &nbsp;</p><p>Over 70 (or 6%) of the health facilities in North Kivu have been affected, with some completely destroyed and others struggling to restart operations. Some ambulances have also been damaged. A WHO-supported health clinic in North Kivu was temporarily occupied by armed groups. Health workers have had to flee in places, while in others, they have been working round the clock for days, with limited resources and overwhelming demand, and sometimes at risk to their own lives.</p><p>Cancer, diabetes, hypertension, mental health and other routine services are also affected as medicines have run out and health workers are either absent or overburdened.</p><p>The risk of death during pregnancy and childbirth has increased from already high levels. Given the insecurity, pregnant women cannot reach health facilities for safe delivery. Experience with conflict in the region has shown the drastic effect it has, with the rate of births attended to by skilled health workers dropping to near zero during periods of intense violence.</p><p>The threat of infectious diseases has multiplied. Cholera, malaria, measles, meningitis, mpox and tuberculosis are among the infectious threats in the area. The water supply in Goma was disrupted and has only partially resumed, leading people to use water from the lake, and heightening the risk of cholera spread. Close to 600 suspected cases of cholera and 14 deaths were reported from North Kivu between 1 and 27 January.</p><p>Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, especially South Kivu province, is the epicentre of the mpox outbreak that prompted the WHO Director-General to declare a public health emergency of international concern last August. The mpox response is heavily impacted. Ninety percent of the mpox patients (128 of 143) in isolation units in Goma had fled for safety, making it nearly impossible to provide them with care, and increasing the risk of spread.</p><p>One in four people in the region was already facing emergency levels of hunger, with the recent violence expected to worsen the situation. Malnutrition and disease go hand-in-hand: malnourished people are less able to fight disease, while disease leads to further malnutrition. This vicious circle is especially concerning when it comes to children, and pregnant and breastfeeding women.</p><p>Goma was home to over 2 million people, including 700&nbsp;000 people displaced by this crisis. These people have had to flee yet again, in search of safety. They are in temporary settlements, with their health and safety at risk.</p><p>A rapid assessment of 10 healthcare facilities in and around Goma showed a concerning rise in rape and other gender-based violence: there were 45 cases reported among the displaced, and 21 survivors of gang-rape admitted to two hospitals. These numbers are only the tip of the iceberg. These patients require medical care, psychological support, and support with maintaining their livelihood, especially when they are the sole providers for their families.</p><p>WHO has deployed emergency medical supplies, hygiene and water treatment supplies, and tents to increase hospital capacity by 1000 beds. Supplies are being depleted rapidly, and more resources are urgently needed.</p><p>WHO is preparing further deliveries as part a European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO)-led effort to fly in critical supplies. For this, the Goma airport, a critical lifeline, must be urgently reopened. WHO is also exploring options to deliver critical supplies through other routes.</p><p>WHO and partners were able to resume mpox vaccination in Goma on Wednesday, 5&nbsp;February after a 10 day pause.</p><p>The United States&rsquo; recent decision to freeze foreign aid is significantly impacting relief efforts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Last year, the US contributed to as much as 70% of the country&rsquo;s humanitarian response. Additionally, the US is a major funder of the mpox response, and has pledged a million vaccine doses of its own stock to global efforts. While WHO&rsquo;s humanitarian response in the region relies on funding from other donors&mdash;including the European Union, United Kingdom and the WHO&rsquo;s Contingency Fund for Emergencies&mdash;reductions in overall aid will have repercussions on people&rsquo;s health.</p><p>To meet immediate health needs in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, including for safe and dignified burials, WHO has spent US$&nbsp;600&nbsp;000. The overall response requires US$ 50 million.</p><p>WHO calls for humanitarian access, the protection of health workers and facilities, and an end to attacks on health care. Health facilities, supplies, workers and patients should be protected. Ultimately, we call for peace, and an end to the unimaginable and long suffering of the people in this region.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

This harmful practice affects more than 230&nbsp;million girls and women today. An estimated 27&nbsp;million more girls could endure this violation of their rights and dignity by 2030 if we do not take action now.<br /></p><p>Today, on the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation, and in response to the theme \"Stepping up the pace: Strengthening alliances and building movements to end female genital mutilation\", UNFPA, UNICEF and WHO reaffirm our commitment to work together with countries and communities to end this harmful practice &ndash; once and for all.<br /></p><p>There is hope. Many countries have seen a decline in the prevalence of female genital mutilation. We are witnessing progress in countries like Kenya and Uganda, where collaborative action and community-led initiatives are proving that by strengthening alliances and building movements, we can accelerate change. <br /></p><p>Since the launch of the UNFPA-UNICEF Joint Programme on the Elimination of Female Genital Mutilation in 2008, and in collaboration with WHO, close to 7&nbsp;million girls and women access prevention and protection services. Additionally, 48&nbsp;million people have made public declarations to abandon the practice, and 220&nbsp;million individuals were reached by mass media messaging on the issue. In the last two years, close to 12&nbsp;000 grassroots organizations and 112&nbsp;000 community and frontline workers galvanized to effect change at this critical juncture.<br /></p><p>Yet the fragility of progress made has also become starkly evident. In the Gambia, for example, attempts to repeal the ban on female genital mutilation persist, even after an initial proposal to do so was rejected by its parliament last year. Such efforts could gravely undermine the rights, health and dignity of future generations of girls and women, jeopardizing the tireless work over decades to change attitudes and mobilize communities. <s></s><br /></p><p>Of the 31 countries in which data on prevalence are collected nationally, only seven countries are on track to meet the Sustainable Development Goal of ending female genital mutilation by or before 2030. The current rate of progress must accelerate urgently to meet this target.<br /></p><p>This requires strengthened alliances among leaders, grassroots organizations and across sectors spanning health, education and social protection &ndash; as well as sustained advocacy and expanded social movements with girls and survivors at the centre. <br /></p><p>It demands greater accountability at all levels to ensure commitments to human rights are upheld and policies and strategies are implemented to protect girls at risk and provide care, including justice, for survivors. It also requires increased investment in scaling up proven interventions. We are indebted to generous donors and partners who are supporting this life-changing work and call on others to join them.<br /></p><p>We all have a role to play to ensure that every girl is protected and can live free from harm. Let&rsquo;s step up the pace and act with urgency.

            "description": "<p></p><p>In a global first, Uganda&rsquo;s Ministry of Health, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners today launched a first-ever clinical efficacy trial for a vaccine from Ebola from the Sudan species of the virus, and at an unprecedented speed for a randomized vaccine trial, in an emergency. This is the first trial to assess the clinical efficacy of a vaccine against Ebola Sudan virus disease. IAVI, the provider of the vaccine, conducted trials for safety and immunogenicity. It is also the first clinical trial of the vaccine during an outbreak.</p><p>The principal investigators&nbsp;from Makerere University and the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI), with support from WHO and other partners, have worked tirelessly to get the trial ready in 4 days since the outbreak was confirmed on 30 January. It is the first trial to assess the clinical efficacy of a vaccine against Ebola disease due to Sudan virus. The speed was achieved through advanced research preparedness, while ensuring full compliance with national and international regulatory and ethical requirements. </p><p>The candidate vaccine was donated by IAVI, with financial support from WHO, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Canada&rsquo;s International Development Research Centre (IDRC), and the European Commission's Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) and support from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC).</p><p>&ldquo;This is a critical achievement towards better pandemic preparedness, and saving lives when outbreaks occur,&rdquo; said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO&rsquo;s Director-General.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is possible because of the dedication of Uganda&rsquo;s health workers, the involvement of communities, the Ministry of Health of Uganda, Makerere University and UVRI, and research efforts led by WHO involving hundreds of scientists through our research and development Filoviruses network. We thank our partners for their dedication and cooperation, from IAVI for donating the vaccine, to CEPI, EU HERA and Canada&rsquo;s IDRC for funding, and Africa CDC for further support. This massive achievement would simply not be possible without them.&rdquo;</p><p>In 2022, during the previous outbreak of Ebola disease (also from the Sudan species of the virus) in Uganda, a randomized protocol for candidate vaccines was developed. Principal investigators were designated under the leadership of the Minister of Health, and teams were trained to allow such a trial to take place during an active outbreak. </p><p>The randomized vaccine trial to assess the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) candidate vaccine was launched&nbsp;at a ceremony in Kampala today by the Minister of Health of Uganda. WHO is co-sponsoring the trial. WHO was represented by Dr Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO&rsquo;s Health Emergencies Programme and Deputy Director-General, and the WHO representative to Uganda Dr Kasonde Mwinga, along with other colleagues.</p><p>Three vaccination rings were defined today. The first ring involves about 40 contacts and contacts of contacts of the first reported and confirmed case, a health worker who has died. </p><p><strong></strong>Although several promising candidate medical countermeasures are progressing through clinical development, as of now, there is no licensed vaccine available to effectively combat a potential future outbreak of Ebola disease from the Sudan species of the virus. Licensed vaccines exist only for the disease caused by Ebola virus, formerly known as Za&iuml;re ebolavirus. Likewise for treatments, approved treatments are only available for Ebola virus. </p><p>The vaccine for the trial was recommended by the independent WHO candidate vaccine prioritization working group. If the candidate vaccine is effective, it can contribute to controlling this outbreak and generate data for vaccine licensure. </p><p>In 2022, the research teams were trained in good clinical practice (GCP) and standard operating procedures for such trials. They completed refresher training in recent days.

            "description": "<p>WHO and partners have immediately boosted their support to the Ugandan government&rsquo;s response to an outbreak of Sudan virus disease outbreak (SVD, part of the Ebola family), including by facilitating access to a candidate vaccine and candidate treatments. The first 2160 doses of the vaccine candidate and the treatments are already in Kampala, Uganda, as they were prepositioned as part of outbreak preparedness. &nbsp;</p><p>The vaccine trial processes underway include orientation of the research teams on the trial procedures, and logistics arrangements. Research teams have been deployed to the field to work along with the surveillance teams as approvals are awaited.</p><p>The candidate vaccine and the candidate treatments (a monoclonal antibody and an antiviral) are being made available through clinical trial protocols, which will make it possible to further document their efficacy and safety.</p><p>As of 30 January, <a href=\"https://www.afro.who.int/countries/uganda/news/who-accelerates-efforts-support-response-sudan-virus-disease-outbreak-uganda\">there was one confirmed case and 45 contacts who are being followed up</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>Uganda has experienced five previous SVD outbreaks. The last one was declared in September 2022 and ended in January 2023, with 164 cases and 77 deaths. During that outbreak, a WHO committee of external experts evaluated candidate vaccines and provided recommendations on their suitability for evaluation in Uganda, as part of a clinical trial against the SVD virus.</p><p>WHO is working with the Ministry of Health of Uganda and its designated Ugandan Principal Investigators and their teams from Makerere University Lung Institute and the Ugandan Virus Research Institute, as well as worldwide filovirus and trial experts and regulators, to initiate the trials.</p><p>The trials were designed via a <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2024/02/20/default-calendar/building-research-readiness-for-a-future-filovirus-outbreak-workshop-february-20-22-2024-uganda\">global collaborative effort</a> coordinated by WHO, that included developers, academic institutions, regulatory authorities, other experts and researchers from Uganda and other countries at risk of filoviruses outbreaks.</p><p>The aim of the vaccine trial is to evaluate a potentially efficacious candidate vaccine, and if efficacious, to possibly contribute to ending the ongoing outbreak and protect populations at risk in the future. Those eligible to join the trial are those at highest risk of SVD, i.e. close contacts of a person who has been confirmed to have had SVD or who has died from the disease. The study sites will therefore be the locations where contacts of the case or cases reside. Study teams will be mobile and able to rapidly move to these areas to do their work using the ring vaccination approach.</p><p>WHO is working with the Ministry of Health and with Makerere University Lung Institute and the Ugandan Virus Research Institute, who will lead the trials&rsquo; implementation.</p><p>The development of the protocols and research priorities has been done via the MARVAC Consortium and the Collaborative Open Research Consortium (CORC) for the Filoviridae Family, and numerous developers facilitated the availability of the candidate vaccine and treatments: IAVI provided their candidate Sudan vaccine, Gilead provided remdesivir, an antiviral.</p><p>Among those supporting the trials&rsquo; implementation are the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, Canada&rsquo;s International Development Research Centre, the European Commission's Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) and WHO. This rapid action is the result of tireless efforts to build international cooperation on research, innovation and evaluation and deployment of countermeasures in the face of dangerous pathogens.</p><p>While outbreaks of SVD are controllable without vaccines, control can be achieved more quickly using safe and effective vaccines. In the meantime, a comprehensive outbreak response is underway in Uganda to rapidly halt transmission, identify contacts and carry out epidemiological investigations, while enhancing community awareness.</p><p>WHO has allocated US$ 1 million from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies to help accelerate outbreak control efforts.</p><p>Sudan virus disease is a severe, often fatal illness affecting humans and other primates that is due to Orthoebolavirus sudanense (Sudan virus), a viral species belonging to the same genus of the virus causing Ebola virus disease.&nbsp; Case fatality rates of Sudan virus disease have varied from 41% to 100% in past outbreaks. There are no approved treatments or vaccines for Sudan virus, but early initiation of supportive treatment has been shown to significantly reduce deaths from Sudan virus disease.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

With today&rsquo;s announcement, Georgia joins the ranks of <a href=\"https://www.who.int/teams/global-malaria-programme/elimination/countries-and-territories-certified-malaria-free-by-who\"></a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/teams/global-malaria-programme/elimination/countries-and-territories-certified-malaria-free-by-who\">45 countries and 1 territory </a>that have achieved this milestone.</p><p>&ldquo;Today we congratulate the people of Georgia for their decades of targeted and sustained actions to eliminate malaria, one of the world&rsquo;s leading killers,&rdquo; said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. &ldquo;Georgia&rsquo;s commitment and success gives us hope that a malaria-free world is possible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is a huge milestone worth marking; with Georgia&rsquo;s achievement, the WHO European Region is another step closer to initiate certification as the first malaria-free region in the world,&rdquo; said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe. &ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t happen in a vacuum, this was made possible thanks to sustained investment, dedication of the health workforce and targeted efforts in prevention, early detection and effective treatment of all malaria cases.&rdquo;</p><p>Certification of malaria elimination is granted by WHO when a country has proven, beyond reasonable doubt, that the chain of indigenous transmission has been interrupted nationwide for at least the previous three consecutive years.</p><p>The Minister of Health, Mikheil Sarjveladze, noted that certifying Georgia as malaria-free is a recognition of the sustainability of its healthcare system, &ldquo;this success means that Georgia can address important health challenges.\"</p><h2>A longstanding challenge</h2><p>Malaria has plagued Georgia since ancient times. Before the introduction of systematic control efforts in the early 1900s, at least 3 malaria parasite species&mdash;<em>P. falciparum, P. malariae and P. vivax</em>&mdash;were endemic in the country. In the 1920s, an estimated 30% of the population suffered from malaria caused by the <em>P. vivax</em> malaria species.</p><p>By 1940, large-scale mosquito control programmes had helped reduce malaria cases significantly through improved access to diagnostic and treatment facilities. A few years later, however, World War II caused a surge again due to population movement and the strain on health facilities.&nbsp; </p><p>In the post-war period, Georgia launched an intensive programme aimed at eliminating malaria, using newer medicines, insecticide spraying and robust entomological surveillance. The campaign successfully interrupted the transmission of <em>P. falciparum</em> by 1953, <em>P. malariae</em> by 1960 and <em>P. vivax</em> by 1970.&nbsp; </p><p>Georgia remained malaria-free for 25 years, but by 2002, malaria had reemerged in the country with 474 cases reported. </p><h2>Renewed commitments to stop the disease</h2><p>In 2005, together with 9 other countries in the WHO European Region, Georgia signed the Tashkent Declaration, reaffirming its pledge to eliminate malaria. The intensified interventions that followed significantly reduced malaria incidence in Georgia, with the last indigenous case recorded in 2009. By 2015, all 53 countries of the WHO European Region, including Georgia, reported zero indigenous cases of malaria.</p><p>To prevent further re-establishment of malaria transmission in the region, the original signatories of the Tashkent Declaration issued the Ashgabat Statement in 2017 committing to take all efforts to remain malaria-free. T&uuml;rkiye is the only country in the WHO European Region remaining to be certified. </p><p>In 2024, during the Georgia&rsquo;s malaria-free certification process, members of the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/groups/technical-advisory-group-on-malaria-elimination-and-certification\">Technical Advisory Group on Malaria Elimination and Certification</a>, an independent WHO advisory body, noted that Georgia has a well-functioning and adequately resourced health system, strong public-private cooperation, and political commitment to maintaining a malaria-free status. </p><h3><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3><h3><strong>Note to the editor</strong></h3><p><strong>WHO malaria-free certification</strong><strong> </strong></p><p>The final decision on awarding a malaria-free certification is made by the WHO Director-General, based on a recommendation by the Technical Advisory Group on Malaria Elimination and Certification and validation from the Malaria Policy Advisory Group.

The entire population of Gaza has faced multiple displacements. More than 46 600 people have been killed and over 110 000 have been injured. The real figures are likely much higher. Only half of Gaza&rsquo;s 36 hospitals remain partially operational, nearly all hospitals are damaged or partly destroyed, and just 38% of primary health care centres are functional. An estimated 25% of those injured &ndash; around 30 000 people &ndash; face life-changing injuries and will need ongoing rehabilitation. Specialized health care is largely unavailable, medical evacuations abroad are extremely slow. Transmission of infectious diseases has massively increased, malnutrition is rising, and the risk of famine persists. The breakdown of public order, exacerbated by armed gangs, raises further concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Addressing the massive needs and restoring the health system will be an extremely complex and challenging task, given the scale of destruction, operational complexity and constraints involved.

However, it is critical that the security obstacles hindering operations are removed. WHO will need conditions on the ground that allow systematic access to the population across Gaza, enabling the influx of aid via all possible borders and routes, and lifting restrictions on the entry of essential items. Also essential are active protection of civilians and health-care workers, expediting medical evacuations through all possible routes for over 12 000 patients (and their companions) who urgently require specialized care, strengthening and speeding up the referral system to East Jerusalem and the West Bank, and addressing road repairs, rubble removal, and the remediation of unexploded ordnances.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">WHO and partners will need a massive scale-up of funding to meet immediate health needs, and to begin to restore the heath system, including the workforce, supply chain and infrastructure.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">WHO and partners will implement a 60-day plan to support the urgent restoration and expansion of the health system. Focus will be on key priority response areas, including trauma and emergency care, comprehensive primary health care, child health, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), rehabilitation, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Given the immense needs, WHO is scaling up operations and mobilizing critical supplies and resources for delivery into Gaza. A priority will be the assessment and rehabilitation of partially damaged health facilities in high-need areas. Work is ongoing to urgently increase bed capacity across selected hospitals in northern and southern Gaza, together with the expansion of operational capacities, supporting the hiring and redistribution of national health workers, and increasing deployment of international health workers to fill gaps. Plans are underway to integrate prefabricated clinics and hospitals with existing health facilities to enhance service delivery in underserved and newly accessible areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Efforts also are underway to strengthen referral processes for critical care within Gaza and facilitate cross-border medical evacuations. Given the high level of malnutrition and disease outbreaks, WHO is working with partners to expand infant and young child feeding programmes, enhance immunization efforts and reinforce disease surveillance systems for timely prevention, reporting, and outbreak management.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">WHO calls on all parties to uphold their commitment to fully implement the ceasefire agreement and to continue working towards a political solution to address the protracted crisis in the occupied Palestinian territory, which is essential for lasting peace.&nbsp;</span><br /></p>",
